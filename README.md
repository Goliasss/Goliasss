### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm soon about to be a fresh graduate from a master's programme in Statistics at the University of Copenhagen and I'm looking forward to new opportunities as a young Data Scientist.

Throughout my studies I got comfortable with abstract mathematics and statistics, helping me understand many of the machine learning topics into its very core fundamentals. I believe that understanding machine learning and statistics deeply on a conceptual level is vital for high quality results. 

Iâ€™m currently working on transforming my master's thesis into a publication at the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Univeristy of Copenhagen.

Please feel free to check out my previous work in my repositories!
