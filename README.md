### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm soon about to be a fresh graduate from a master's programme in Statistics at the University of Copenhagen and I'm looking forward to new opportunities as a young Data Scientist.

Throughout my studies I got comfortable with abstract mathematics and statistics, helping me understand many of the machine learning topics into its very core fundamentals. I believe that understanding machine learning and statistics deeply on a conceptual level is vital for high quality results. 

Iâ€™m currently working on transforming my master's thesis into a publication at the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, Univeristy of Copenhagen.

Please feel free to check out my previous work in my repositories!

Lately I've been mainly working in R, however, I am also fluent in Python and it's core Data Science and Deep Learning libraries.
